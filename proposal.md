## Proposal
Foodborne illnesses are very prevalent in today's society because of their wide reach. Food is a necessity to survive and any foodborne illnesses that effect a major food source can have catastrophic effects. Elaine Scallan says that by using a variety of methods and sources, an estimated 31 major pathogens cause 9.4 million cases of foodborne illnesses in the United States. These illnesses can have effects ranging from mild sickness, to hospitalization, to death. Additionally, in a world of ever changing politics, according to Scallan, "estimates of foodborne illnesses can be used to direct food safety policy and interventions." Foodborne illnesses have importance because of their widespread effects, ranging from sickness to death, to governmental policy issues.
