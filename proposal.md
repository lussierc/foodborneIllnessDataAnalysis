## Proposal
Foodborne illnesses are very prevalent in today's society because of their wide reach. Food is a necessity to survive and any foodborne illnesses that effect a major food source can have catastrophic effects. A paper by Scallan, Elaine, et al., says that by using a variety of methods and sources, an estimated 31 major pathogens cause 9.4 million cases of foodborne illnesses yearly in the United States. These illnesses can have effects ranging from mild sickness, to hospitalization, to death. Additionally, in a world of ever changing politics, according to Scallan, "estimates of foodborne illnesses can be used to direct food safety policy and interventions." Foodborne illnesses have importance because of their widespread effects, ranging from sickness to death, to governmental policy issues.

Foodborne illnesses are important for a variety of different reasons. As mentioned earlier, foodborne illnesses are very widespread, causing around 9.4 million cases of foodborne illnesses in the United States each year (Scallan, Elaine, et al.). Similarly, 800 foodborne disease outbreaks are reported in the United States each year (Dewey-Mattia, Daniel, et al.). Additionally, foodborne illnesses can cause severe illness that can cause hospitalization. According to Scallan, Elaine, et al., foodborne illnesses cause around 55,961 hospitalizations each year. While simple-seeming illnesses that can cause hospitalization are bad enough on their own, in some cases foodborne illnesses can even cause death. According to Scallan, foodborne illnesses cause around 1,351 deaths each year.

There are many questions that we could ask and try to answer when it comes to the area of foodborne illnesses. As of right now, the main question that we will try to answer is: Is there a correlation between production of food and illnesses? We believe this question is important because if there is a correlation between the two when there is an increase, this shows that the food industry needs to be more heavily regulated. This question may adapt or change as we complete our research. There are several other questions, that are subquestions of a sort to the main questions, that our group will likely try to answer. One of these questions that we have is: Which food groups cause the most foodborne illnesses? This question is important because if specific food groups are causing foodborne illnesses maybe people will start eating them less or maybe they will be more heavily regulated. For example, in the dairy industry foodborne pathogens were found in milk and other dairy products because of contaminated farm equipment, infected cows, and more (Hati, Subrota, Kunal Gawai, and V. Sreeeja). If people knew that foodborne illnesses could be caused by dairy products, maybe they wouldn't consume as many. We also thought it would be interesting to try and answer the question: In which countries are foodborne pathogens and illnesses most prevalent? Additionally, which foodborne illnesses are the most prevalent? We could also ask the question: Which age group is most effected by foodborne illnesses? As we begin to analyze data and complete more research regarding foodborne pathogens it is very likely that some of these questions will adapt and that new ones will be created. Thoroughly answering these questions could help us learn more valuable information about the area of foodborne pathogens.

Right now, there are several policies that cover foodborne illnesses, pathogens, and the like. However, many of these policies are quite small in their scope and are more reactive than proactive. As a result, our group feels it may be a good idea to consider creating a new, broader and more encompassing, policy for foodborne illnesses. This policy would be more proactive in that it would attempt to stop foodborne illnesses from occuring all together by heavily regulating the food industry. This policy could check one item from every batch (or harvest) of a food item. The policy could also call for random checks on food industry manufacturer's plants. These measures would help to stop foodborne illnesses from even leaving the factory. Additionally, if a product hits the shelves and is causing a foodborne illness, every individual item should be recalled (not just the items from one batch, which is what is currently done most of the time) and the product's manufacturer should be heavily investigated. This would help limit the spreading of foodborne diseases and hopefully stop them from happening again in the future. Such a policy would do more to regulate the important food industry in an attempt to prevent the spread of foodborne illnesses.
