## Progress Report
<!-- DELETE THIS BEFORE TURNING IN: Final report (6 or more pages) Deadline: Friday, 13th December, 2018 by 7pm: Incorporate any feedback from the progress report and the presentation session. Your final report should be clear, concise and, most importantly, well written, this includes no typos or grammatical errors. Your report should be written in a professional manner and should include explanation of all of the requirements outlined above. -->

<!-- Intro -- what is our project about? what are we looking at within this scope? -->
Despite advances in food production and healthcare, foodborne illnesses are still widespread and have severe effects even in developed countries like the United States, making them an important topic of discussion in today's society. Foodborne illnesses



<!-- Background information -- what are foodborne illnesses? -->
Foodborne Illness is an illness caused by food contaminated with bacteria, viruses, parasites, or toxins. A few examples include Norovirus, Salmonella, Listeria, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). All potentially deadly if not treated quickly and properly.

<!-- Motivation -- why are foodborne illnesses important? -->
Our motivation for studying this topic was because foodborne illnesses are important. They are important because they are common and everyone has to eat. Foodborne illnesses can also have widespread effects on a population. In the United States, foodborne illnesses can cause around 1300 deaths each year. There is also around 56000 hospitalizations each year.

<!-- What questions does our project aim to answer? -->

<!-- Approach -- how did we do our project? -->
Some approaches we took during this project were comparing all information over the years rather than just a single year to provide a more in depth analysis. We also created a breakdown of the types of illnesses that were most prevalent, along with the locations in which they occur. We then had to determine the main cause of the contamination, which we broke down into the types of food that caused the most illnesses.

<!-- Challenges -- what challenges did we face? how did we overcome them? -->
One of the biggest challenges during this project was finding data to analyze. It was hard to find data for the specific ideas we had such as analyzing specific diseases like e coli and salmonella. When we finally found data that was useful, a lot of it was spread out between different datasets. This created extra work combining smaller datasets to one large dataset that we could analyze. Another big challenge was getting the data into the correct format. We found a lot of datasets that were pdfs needing to be converted to csv files so we could import it into rstudio and perform the analyses, which leads to the the final challenge of deciding what graphs to use when analyzing the data.

<!-- Results -- what did we find? -->
After performing our approach, our results indicate that Restaurants are filthy. We based this around the idea that most of the cases of foodborne illnesses occur at Restaurants, which include sit-down and fast-food. Many of the reason agree with the type of illnesses as well, this will be explained with the upcoming slides. Succinctly though, many food violations are from frozen and packaged food not being stored properly or mice being present in the facility and where they are storing the food.

<!-- Analysis -- What do our results mean? -->

<!-- Our Policy Change -- based on our results an analysis, we think that this should happen with policies. -->

<!-- Conclusion -->



<!-- For challenges: Data downloaded had to be converted, original main dataset not that useful to our overall main question, could not find any useful e.coli data wanted in proposal comments.-->
