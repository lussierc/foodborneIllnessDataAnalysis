## Progress Report
Our project looks to analyze trends regarding foodborne illnesses which remain very prevalent in today's society. With this, our project is trying to answer the question, is there a correlation between the production of food and illnesses? In order to answer this question, our group has taken a variety of steps in the last two weeks to make great progress on our project. We have made significant progress on our final project by completing background research on topic, choosing and examining our main data set, and implementing code that will allow us to better understand this data set.
