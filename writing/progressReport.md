Describe everything you have done so far in your progress report. By this point, you should have conducted necessary research on the background, examined in detail the data set you have selected, decided on the approach you will use to analyze it, and made a significant progress towards implementation. Describe anything new that you have learned so far and any unexpected challenges that you have encountered.

## Progress Report
Our project looks to analyze trends regarding foodborne illnesses which remain very prevalent in today's society. With this, our project is trying to answer the question, is there a correlation between the production of food and illnesses? In order to answer this question, our group has taken a variety of steps in the last two weeks to make great progress on our project. We have made significant progress on our final project by completing background research on topic, choosing and examining our main data set, and implementing code that will allow us to better understand this data set.

We have completed quite a bit of research on our project's background at this point in the research process. Foodborne illnesses are, quite simply, illnesses that are caused by food products in some capacity. According to Fein, Sara B., C-T Jordan Lin, and Alan S. Levy, "consumers play an essential role in foodborne illness prevention." This is because they handle food they prepare themselves and decide if they should eat food that could cause foodborne illnesses, like raw meat (Fein, Sara B., C-T Jordan Lin, and Alan S. Levy). Though this can help prevent foodborne illnesses it can also cause them. Most people are not professional chefs and as a result they may prepare food in a way that is more likely to cause foodborne illnesses. Additionally, consumers obviously choose whether or not to eat something, so they are essentially choosing if they want to increase their risk of catching a foodborne disease. This may be why foodborne illnesses are very common in today's society. foodborne illnesses are very widespread, causing around 9.4 million cases of foodborne illnesses in the United States each year (Scallan, Elaine, et al.). Additionally, 800 foodborne disease outbreaks are reported in the United States each year (Dewey-Mattia, Daniel, et al.).
